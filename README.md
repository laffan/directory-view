An exceedingly simple drag-drop viewer for directories of files. Requires php and some sense of how relative linking works (if you'd like to nest them);

The file scanner (lines 3-49 in `directory-scan.php`) is the thanks to [these folks](http://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/cute-file-browser-jquery-ajax-php/).
